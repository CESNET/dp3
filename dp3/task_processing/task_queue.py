"""
Functions to work with the main task queue (RabbitMQ)

There are two queues for each worker process:
- "normal" queue for tasks added by other components, this has a limit of 100
  tasks.
- "priority" one for tasks added by workers themselves, this has no limit since
  workers mustn't be stopped by waiting for the queue.

These queues are presented as a single one by this wrapper.
The TaskQueueReader first looks into the "priority" queue and only if there
is no task waiting, it reads the normal one.

Tasks are distributed to worker processes (and threads) by hash of the entity
which is to be modified. The destination queue is decided by the message source,
so each source must know how many worker processes are there.

Exchange and queues must be declared externally!

Related configuration keys and their defaults:
(should be part of global DP3 config files)
```
rabbitmq:
  host: localhost
  port: 5672
  virtual_host: /
  username: guest
  password: guest
